/**
 * Some API endpoints in this application are sorted and paginated. Here, we will go over
 * some details about sorting and paginating the resulting movies.
 * 
 * In this applicaiton, we sort the movies in our database based on "popularity" in a decreasing order
 * so that top results are the most popular ones. To learn how to use sort in mongoose,
 * please visit their documentation: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-sort
 * 
 * Pagination is used to return parts of the results to the user in series of pages.
 * You can read about pagination in mongodb here: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/#pagination-example
 * For example imagine that maximum number of items per page is 5 and we have 7 items in
 * out database. As a result, we need to return the first 5 elements in the first page.
 * For the second page, we need to `skip` over the first 5 elements and return the remaining
 * elements (up to a maximum of 5). As a result, our query from the database for paginated
 * results would typically look like this:
 *    const results = await Movie.find({...}).sort({...}).skip((page - 1) * limit).limit(limit)
 * Note: `page` is the page that we want to fetch the results for and `limit` is the maximum
 * number of elements allowed per page. In our previous example, limit was 5.
 * Note: the number of pages can be calculated as `Math.ceil(count / limit)`
 * 
 * In this application, we will use the `DEFAULT_MOVIES_PER_PAGE` variable as the maximum 
 * number of items per page for the endpoints
 * that return a list of movies and `DEFAULT_COMMENTS_PER_PAGE` variable as the maximum 
 * number of items per page for the endpoints that returna  list of comments.
